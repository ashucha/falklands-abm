# datetime.nls
- The minutes-per-tick slider defines the minutes per tick. It's defaulted to 2min because that's most convenient for the SHARs. 
- Currently, none of the behavior actually changes based on minutes-per-tick. I'll incorporate that to the SHARs...at some point.
- Gemini did a bunch of math to convert the dates properly and display them nicely in the interface
- You \*should\* be able to access current stuffs by cur-\<var\>.
