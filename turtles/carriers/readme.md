- There are 2 carriers. They wander around. They launch harriers every so often. 
- There's also a slow turn functionality. Every so often, generate a random new heading and start turning towards it. 
- Every so often, a yellow square pops up. The nearest carrier launches a SHAR pair to go strike it and return.
